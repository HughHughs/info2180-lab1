        <h2>Delano Sewell</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about Web Development because it gives me a way to visualize my code. I love seeing the immediate results of what I create and itâ€™s satisfying to bring an idea to life on a screen. It's also very practical, as I get to learn new skills and techniques with each project. I also hope to pursue a career as a web developer in the near future because I want to combine my creativity with technical skills to build engaging and user-friendly websites.</p>
